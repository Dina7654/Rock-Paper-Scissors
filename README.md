# Rock-Paper-Scissors

I created a rock, paper scissors game where you play against a computer.
The game will prompt you to enter a choice and you will be able to see if you won, the scores and your and the computer's choice after the computer chooses. if you decide to quit by typing 'quit', all final scores will be displayed.
